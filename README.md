# TomoPy Short Course
Lead by Daniel Ching from The US Department of Energyâ€™s Argonne National Laboratory at ICTMS 2019, Cairns, Australia

## Summary
In a 90 minute interactive session, we will learn to reconstruct three-dimensional images from two-dimensional projections using TomoPy, the open-source Python package for tomographic data processing and image reconstruction. The course assumes some knowledge of x-ray computed tomography, but only minimal knowledge of computer programming. Topics covered include common steps to reconstruct x-ray computed tomography data and how to choose a reconstruction algorithm.

## Materials
The short course requires a 64-bit computer running Windows 10, macOS, or Linux, and either internet access or for the instructor to bring the custom miniconda installers for distribution.

## Source
This repository contains the source files to run the workshop.

`constructor.yaml` is for using the [conda constructor](https://github.com/conda/constructor) to create a custom miniconda installer which comes with TomoPy and jupyter notebook preinstalled (no internet needed).
