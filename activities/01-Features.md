# TomoPy Capabilities and Features
[TomoPy](https://tomopy.readthedocs.io) is an open-source Python package for tomography for Unix and Windows 10. Specifically, TomoPy reconstructs parallel beam emission and transmission tomography.

## Features
* Tomographic reconstruction using direct inversion or iterative algorithms.
* A forward projection operator.
* Various artifact suppression algorithms including ring removal, alignment,
  noise suppression, and scaling.
* CPU multiprocessing.
* C/C++ extensions for both CPU and GPU (TomoPy >= 1.5).
* Data format independent.
